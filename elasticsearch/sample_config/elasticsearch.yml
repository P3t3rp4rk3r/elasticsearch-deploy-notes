# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: carbon
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: carbon-1
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
node.attr.machine: edge-machine
#
# Setting current node master
#
node.master: true
#
# Setting current as data node too
#
#node.data: true
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
path.data: /var/data/elasticsearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
# Lock the process address space into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
network.host: ["85.xx.xx.xx", "10.29.103.18"]

network.publish_host: 10.29.103.18
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
http.port: 9201
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts:
    - 10.29.103.18
    - 10.29.103.16
    - 10.29.103.10
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes:
    - atlas-prod-1
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: true
#xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: /etc/elasticsearch/elastic-certificates.p12

xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: "/etc/elasticsearch/http_ssl/http.p12"
